# Leaf
Leaf is an AI based discord chatbot. It has a very minimalistic reply to each and every query.  

There is a missing 'token' text file in this repo. Token is like a password generated by discord for your bot. Each bot gets a unique token when it's created. 
You either have to add your token into the text file and import it, or you could just pass the token as a string into the function.
